# AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript

A suite of utilities for AWS Lambda functions to ease the adoption of best practices such as tracing, structured logging, custom metrics, and more.

You can use the library in both TypeScript and JavaScript code bases.

AWS Lambda Powertools for [Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-python) and  AWS Lambda Powertools for [Java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-java) are also available.

## Features

* **[Tracer](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/tracer/)** - Utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
* **[Logger](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/logger/)** - Structured logging made easier, and a middleware to enrich log items with key details of the Lambda context
* **[Metrics](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/metrics/)** - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)

## Getting started

Find the complete project's [documentation here](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript).

### Installation

The AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript utilities follow a modular approach, similar to the official [AWS SDK v3 for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3).  
Each TypeScript utility is installed as standalone NPM package.

Install all three core utilities at once with this single command:

```shell
npm install @aws-lambda-powertools/logger @aws-lambda-powertools/tracer @aws-lambda-powertools/metrics
```

Or refer to the installation guide of each utility:

ðŸ‘‰ [Installation guide for the **Tracer** utility](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/tracer#getting-started)

ðŸ‘‰ [Installation guide for the **Logger** utility](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/logger#getting-started)

ðŸ‘‰ [Installation guide for the **Metrics** utility](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/metrics#getting-started)

### Examples

* [CDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/tree/main/examples/cdk)
* [SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/tree/main/examples/sam)

### Serverless TypeScript Demo application

The [Serverless TypeScript Demo](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-typescript-demo) shows how to use Lambda Powertools for TypeScript.  
You can find instructions on how to deploy and load test this application in the [repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-typescript-demo).
