# AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript

A suite of TypeScript utilities for AWS Lambda functions to ease adopting best practices such as tracing, structured logging, custom metrics, and more. (AWS Lambda Powertools for [Python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-python) and AWS Lambda Powertools for [Java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-java) are also available).

* **[Logger](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/logger/)** - Structured logging made easier, and a middleware to enrich log items with key details of the Lambda context
* **[Metrics](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/core/metrics/)** - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)

## Getting started

### Installation

The AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript utilities follow a modular approach, similar to the official [AWS SDK v3 for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3).
Each TypeScript utility is installed as standalone NPM package.
