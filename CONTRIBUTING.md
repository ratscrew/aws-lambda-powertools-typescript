## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct).
For more information, see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq) or contact opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com with any additional questions or comments.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Getting Started

The following steps describe how to set up the AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript repository on your local machine.
The alternative is to use a Cloud IDE like [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) or [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for your development.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript)

### Setup

The following tools need to be installed on your system prior to starting working on a pull request:

- [Node.js >= 16.x](https://nodejs.org/download/release/latest-v16.x/)
  - We recommend using a version in [Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
  - If you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#nvmrc) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) you can install the latest LTS version with `nvm use` or `fnm use` respectively. Both will use the `.nvmrc` file in the project's root.
- [npm 8.x](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  - After installing Node.js, you can install `npm` with `npm install -g npm@next-8` 
- [AWS SAM CLI >= 1.49.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
  - AWS SAM CLI is a command line interface for AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM), it's used in one of the examples, and it's part of the pre-push hook.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  - If you are not planning on making changes to the documentation, you can skip this step.

First, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository, and then run the following commands to clone and initialize the repository locally.

```console
git clone https://github.com/{your-account}/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript.git
cd aws-lambda-powertools-typescript
npm run setup-local
```

We recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work on the repo.
We use `eslint` to keep our code consistent in terms of style and reducing defects. We recommend installing
the [eslint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) as well.

### Repo Layout

The AWS Lambda Powertools is a npm project written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
More specifically, it is a [monorepo managed using lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#about).
If you're unfamiliar with any of these technologies, it is useful to learn about them and will make understanding the codebase easier but strictly not necessary for simple contributions.

The repo contains `packages/` directory that contains the Powertools utilities modules. For instance, the source code for the Logger utility can be found at the location `packages/logger` and so on.
The repo also contains a `packages/commons` directory that holds code and logic shared between one or more utilities and that is published as a separate npm package.

### Tests

Tests are under the `tests` folder of each module and split into two categories: unit tests and e2e (end-to-end) tests.

You can run each group separately or all together thanks to [jest-runner-groups](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-runner-groups).

Unit tests, under `tests/unit` folder, are standard [Jest](https://jestjs.io) tests.

End-to-end tests, under `tests/e2e` folder, will test the module features by deploying AWS Lambda functions into your AWS Account. We use [aws-cdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) v2 library with TypeScript for creating infrastructure, and [aws-sdk-js v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/) for invoking the functions and asserting on the expected behaviors. All steps are also executed by Jest.

Running end-to-end tests will deploy AWS resources. You will need an AWS account, and the tests might incur costs. The cost from **some services** are covered by the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all) but not all of them. If you don't have an AWS Account, follow [these instructions to create one](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

When contributing to this repository, these end-to-end tests are run by the maintainers before merging a PR.

#### Unit tests

##### Write

As mentioned before, tests are split into groups thanks to [jest-runner-groups](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-runner-groups), and therefore, each test needs to be tagged properly by adding the following comments in the header of your unit test file:

```typescript
/**
 * Tests metrics
 *
 * @group unit/<YOUR CATEGORY>/<YOUR SUB CATEGORY>
 */
```

##### Run

To run unit tests, you can either use:

* npm task `lerna-test:unit` (`npm run lerna-test:unit`) in root folder to run them all
* npm task `test:unit` (`npm run test:unit`) in module folder (for example: `packages/metrics`) to run the module specific ones
* jest directly `npx jest --group=unit` in module folder to run the module specific ones (You can run selective tests by restricting the group to the one you want. For instance `npx jest --group=unit/metrics/class`)

#### e2e tests

##### Set up

We create e2e testing infrastructure with CDK. If you have never used it before, please check its [Getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html). You need to run `cdk bootstrap` in the account and region you are going to run e2e tests in.

##### Write

As mentioned in the previous section, tests are split into groups thanks to [jest-runner-groups](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-runner-groups), and therefore, each test needs to be tagged properly by adding the following comments in the header of your unit test file:

```typescript
/**
 * Tests data lake catalog
 *
 * @group e2e/<YOUR CATEGORY>/<YOUR SUB CATEGORY>
 */
```

Follow this convention for the test filename: `<TESTED_FEATURE>.<USAGE_TYPE>.test.ts`. (e.g. `sampleRate.decorator.test.ts`, `childLogger.manual.test.ts`)

See `metrics/tests/e2e/basicFeatures.decorator.test.ts` as an example.

##### Run

To run e2e tests, you can either use:

* npm task `lerna-test:e2e` (`npm run lerna-test:e2e`) in root folder
* npm task `test:e2e` (`npm run test:e2e`) in module folder (for example: `packages/metrics`) to run the module specific ones
* jest directly `npx jest --group=e2e` in module folder. (You can run selective tests by restricting the group to the one you want. For instance `npx jest --group=e2e/metrics/decorator`)

Three important environment variables can be used:

* `AWS_PROFILE` to use the right AWS credentials
* `AWS_REGION` to select the region to deploy e2e tests infrastructure to
* `DISABLE_TEARDOWN` if you don't want your stack to be destroyed at the end of the test (useful in dev mode when iterating over your code).

Example: `DISABLE_TEARDOWN=true AWS_PROFILE=dev-account AWS_REGION=eu-west-1 npx jest --group=e2e/metrics/decorator`

##### Automate

You can run the end-to-end tests automatically on your forked project by following these steps:

1. Create an IAM role in your target AWS account, with the least amount of privilege.

    As mentioned above in this page, we are leveraging CDK to deploy and consequently clean-up resources on AWS. Therefore, to run those tests through GitHub actions, you will need to grant specific permissions to your workflow.  

    We recommend following [Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html) for the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:
    * Do not store credentials in your repository's code.
    * [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) to the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.  Grant only the permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.
    * [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log) of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.

    For an example of how to create a role in CDK, you can look at [@pahud/cdk-github-oidc](https://constructs.dev/packages/@pahud/cdk-github-oidc) construct.

    More information about:  

    * [GitHub OpenID Connect](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-github-actions-secure-cloud-deployments-with-openid-connect/)
    * ["Configure AWS Credentials" Action For GitHub Actions](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/)

2. Add your new role into your [GitHub fork secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with name `AWS_ROLE_ARN_TO_ASSUME`.
3. In your forked repository, go to the "Actions" tab and select the `run-e2e-tests` workflow.
4. On the `run-e2e-tests` workflow page, select "Run workflow" and run it on the desired branch.

> :warning: **Don't automatically run end-to-end tests on branch push or PRs**. A malicious attacker can submit a pull request to attack your AWS account. Ideally, use a blank account without any important workload/data, and limit `AWS_ROLE_ARN_TO_ASSUME` permission to least minimum privilege.

### Examples

As part of the repo you will find an examples folder at the root. This folder contains examples (written with CDK and SAM) of deployable AWS Lambda functions using Powertools.

To test your updates with these examples, you just have to:

1. Build your local version of *aws-lambda-powertools-typescript* npm packages with `npm run lerna-package` while in the root folder
2. Move to the examples folder of your choice
    ```sh
    cd packages/examples/cdk
    # or
    cd packages/examples/sam
    ```
3. Update their references in examples
    ```sh   
    npm install ../../packages/**/dist/aws-lambda-powertools-*
    ```
4. Run cdk tests
    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```
5. Deploy
    ```sh
    npm run cdk deploy
    # or
    sam build  --beta-features
    sam deploy --guided
    ```

The last step will deploy AWS resources, therefore, you will need an AWS account, and it might incur some costs which should be covered by the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all). If you don't have an AWS Account, follow [these instructions to create one](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).

### Local documentation

You might find useful to run both the documentation website and the API reference locally while contributing.

#### API reference

You can build and start the API reference website by running these two commands in the project's root:

* `npm run docs-generateApiDoc` OR `typedoc .`
* `npm run docs-runLocalApiDoc` OR `npx live-server api`

#### Docs website

You can build and start a local docs website by running:  

`npm run docs-website-build-run`

Alternatively you can run these two commands:

* `npm run docs-buildDockerImage` OR `docker build -t squidfunk/mkdocs-material ./docs/`
* `npm run docs-runLocalDocker` OR `docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material`

### Conventions

Category | Convention
------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Docstring** |  We use [JSDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) annotations to provide type information and create API references.
**Style guide** | We use `eslint` to keep our code consistent in terms of style and reducing defects.
**Test coverage** | We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test our code and [Codecov](https://codecov.io/) to report test coverage. We aim to have 100% test coverage in our unit tests.
**Git commits** | We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). These are not enforced as we squash and merge PRs, but PR titles are enforced during CI.
**Documentation** | API reference docs are generated from docstrings which should have an Examples section to allow developers to have what they need within their own IDE. Documentation website covers the wider usage, tips, and strives to be concise.

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated.

### Summary

* This project uses `node@16.x` and `npm@8.x` for development (see [Setup](#setup)).
* Before opening a Pull Request, please find the existing related issue or open a new one to discuss the proposed changes. A PR without a related issue or discussion has a high risk of being rejected. We are very appreciative and thankful for your time and efforts, and we want to make sure they are not wasted.
* After your proposal has been reviewed and accepted by at least one of the project's maintainers, you can submit a pull request.
* When opening a PR, make sure to follow the checklist inside the pull request template.

### Step 1: Find something to work on

If you want to contribute a specific feature or fix you have in mind, look at active [pull
requests](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/pulls) to see if someone else is already working on it. If not, you can start designing your changes. 

On the other hand, if you are here looking for an issue to work on, check out our [backlog of
issues](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/issues) and find something that piques your interest. Our project, by default, uses the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/help wanted/invalid/question/documentation), looking at any issue labeled as 'help wanted' or 'good-first-issue' is a great place to start.

It's a good idea to keep the priority of issues in mind when deciding what to
work on. If we have labelled an issue as `priority:medium` or `priority:low`, it means it's something we won't
get to soon while `priority:high` issues have a bigger impact, so we are much more likely to give a PR for those issues prompt attention.

### Step 2: Design

You can start by checking the project's tenets [here](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/latest/#tenets).

We ask you to seek feedback and consensus on your proposed change by iterating on a design document. This is especially useful when you plan a big change or feature, or you want advice on what would be the best path forward.

If you're picking up an existing issue, you can simply post your comment and discuss your proposed changes. If instead you're proposing a new feature, you can start by creating a new [RFC issue](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript/issues/new?assignees=&labels=RFC%2C+triage&template=rfc.md&title=RFC%3A+) and discuss your proposed change with the maintainers.

This is a great way to get feedback on your proposed change and make sure that it is in line with the project's direction and community needs. You can start working on the change when you've gotten approved by at least one maintainer - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

### Step 3: Work your Magic

Work your magic. Before starting, make sure to check the [Getting Started](#Getting-Started) section to setup your dev environment and familiarize yourself with the project's structure and design. Here are some additional guidelines:

* Working against the latest source on the **main** branch.
* Try to maintain a single feature/bugfix per pull request. It's okay to introduce a little bit of housekeeping
  changes along the way, but try to avoid conflating multiple features. Eventually, all these are going to go into a
  single commit, so you can use that to frame your scope.
* Try to add [unit tests](#Tests) that test your changes when applicable. This is especially important for new features and bug fixes, as it helps you to make sure that your changes are working as intended.
* Lint and test the code. When you've setup the repository with `npm run init-environment`, pre-commit and push-hooks will automatically lint and test the code. Pull request builds will run the same checks as well.

### Step 4: Pull Request

* Create a commit with your changes and push them to a
  [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
  > Note: Core members can push directly to a branch on the AWS Lambda Powertools (TypeScript) repo (following the same conventions detailed below).
* Create a [pull request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

* Pull request title and message (and PR title and description) must adhere to
  [conventionalcommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
  * The title must begin with `feat(module): title`, `fix(module): title`, `refactor(module): title` or
    `chore(module): title`, etc.
  * Title should be lowercase.
  * No period at the end of the title.

* Pull request message should describe _motivation_ and follow the template provided as closely as possible. Think about your code reviewers and what information they need in order to understand what you did. If it's a big commit (hopefully not), try to provide some good entry points so it will be easier to follow.

* Pull request message should indicate which issue or RFC it relates to in the "Related issues, RFCs" section.

* Shout out to collaborators.

* If not obvious (i.e. from unit tests), describe how you verified that your change works.

* If this PR includes breaking changes, they must be listed at the end in the "Breaking change checklist" section.

* Once the pull request is submitted, a reviewer will be assigned by the maintainers.

* Discuss review comments and iterate until you get at least one "Approve". When iterating, push new commits to the
  same branch. Usually, all these are going to be squashed when the maintainers merge to `main`. The commit messages should be hints
  for you when you finalize your merge commit message.

* Make sure to update the PR title/description if things change. The PR title/description are going to be used as the
  commit title/message and will appear in the CHANGELOG and Release Notes, so maintain them all the way throughout the process.

* Do not remove the legal notice at the end of the PR message. This is a requirement for any pull request to be
  reviewed & accepted.

### Step 5: Merge

* Once approved and tested, one of the maintainers will squash-merge to `main` and will use your PR title/description will be used as the commit message. Your name will be also added to the Release Notes of the next release.
